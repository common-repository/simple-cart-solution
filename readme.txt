== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it update when the user adds an item through WooCommerce product pages? =

Yes. Each integrations uses the hooks provided by those plugins. WooCommerce provides a way to update several parts of the page.
We hook on their hooks and when the WooCommerce updates the cart, we also update the popup.

= Do I need to configure it before using it? =

No. Just activating the plugin will make the cart button appear at the bottom left of your site.
The plugin will recognize which e-commerce plugin you're using (WooCommerce for example) and use that integration.
